# Presentail Scanner Agent

A lightweight Windows tray application that watches `C:\PresentailScanner\Inbox`, detects completed scan files (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG), and uploads them to Presentail OS via the scanner upload API.

## Tray Icon States

| State      | Color  | Meaning                                        |
|------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Connected  | Green  | Paired, online, no queued files                |
| Uploading  | Blue   | Actively uploading a file                      |
| Offline    | Amber  | Network unavailable or files queued for retry  |
| Error      | Red    | Credential revoked — re-pair required          |

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **Windows** (for keytar / winreg native modules; the packaged installer requires Windows)
- pnpm (for the monorepo) or npm (for this package in isolation)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install --filter @workspace/scanner-agent --frozen-lockfile
```

### Regenerate Windows and tray icons

```bash
node scripts/generate-icons.js
```

### Build TypeScript

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/scanner-agent run build
```

### Run in development

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/scanner-agent run dev
```

---

## Building the Windows Installer

> **Requires a Windows host or a CI runner with `windows-latest`.** Electron Builder
> cross-compiles the NSIS installer but native modules (keytar, better-sqlite3) must
> be rebuilt for Windows.

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/scanner-agent run dist:win
pnpm --filter @workspace/scanner-agent run verify-release
```

The installer is written to **`release/`**:

```
release/
├── Presentail-Scanner-Agent-1.0.0-x64.exe
├── latest.yml
├── SHA256SUMS.txt
└── RELEASE-METADATA.json
```

### What the installer does

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Install directory** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PresentailScannerAgent\` — per-user, no UAC elevation |
| **Scanner directories** | Creates `C:\PresentailScanner\{Inbox,Uploaded,Failed}` if absent (idempotent) |
| **Start Menu shortcut** | Always created |
| **Desktop shortcut** | User is asked during install (optional) |
| **Launch after install** | Agent launches automatically on first install |
| **Upgrade** | Preserves `queue.db`, Credential Manager entry, and auto-start Registry key |
| **Uninstall** | Warns if `Inbox\` or `Failed\` contain files; does **not** delete `C:\PresentailScanner\` |

---

## Code Signing

Code signing is an **external prerequisite** — no certificate is bundled.

The build **succeeds unsigned** when the environment variables are absent (suitable for
development and internal testing). Unsigned builds show a Windows SmartScreen warning
at install time.

To sign the installer and executable, set these environment variables before running
`npm run dist`:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CSC_LINK` | Path or base64-encoded PFX certificate. Base64: `certutil -encode cert.pfx cert.b64` (Windows) or `base64 cert.pfx` (Linux/macOS CI) |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the PFX certificate |

Electron Builder reads `CSC_LINK` / `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` automatically when set. No
changes to `package.json` are needed — the env vars are the switch.

For EV certificates via Azure Key Vault or DigiCert KeyLocker, see:
<https://www.electron.build/code-signing>

---

## Auto-Update

The agent uses `electron-updater` to check for new versions:

- **On startup** (after a 10-second delay to let the app settle)
- **Every 4 hours** while running

When a newer version is detected, a Windows notification toast appears:

> **Presentail Scanner Agent** — Update available (v1.x.x) — click to download

Clicking downloads the update. The update installs the next time the agent quits
(or Windows restarts). Credentials and the upload queue are preserved across updates
because they live outside the install directory (`%APPDATA%` and Windows Credential
Manager).

### Configuring the update feed

The default feed URL is the scanner-only rolling channel
`https://github.com/Saade09/Presentail-Scanner-Agent/releases/download/scanner-agent-current`.
It is updated by the Windows release workflow and is independent of unrelated
repository releases. Override via:

```
UPDATE_FEED_URL=https://your-internal-server.com/releases
```

Set this as a system-wide environment variable on the scanner PC if you host releases
internally.

### Publishing a new release

1. Set the package version and push the matching tag `scanner-agent-v<version>`.
2. The **Scanner Agent Windows Release** workflow builds on `windows-latest`,
   verifies the native dependencies, records the SHA-256 checksum, retains the
   files as workflow artifacts, and publishes them as durable GitHub Release assets.
3. Configure Presentail OS with the published
   `SCANNER_AGENT_RELEASE_URL`, `SCANNER_AGENT_RELEASE_VERSION`,
   `SCANNER_AGENT_RELEASE_FILENAME`, and `SCANNER_AGENT_RELEASE_SHA256`.
4. Confirm **Settings → Devices → Invoice Scanners → Download Windows Agent**
   downloads the exact filename recorded in `RELEASE-METADATA.json`.

---

## Pairing Flow

1. Open **Presentail OS → Settings → Devices → Invoice Scanners**, create a station,
   and click **Generate Pairing Code** (valid 15 min).
2. Launch the Scanner Agent; the setup window opens automatically if not paired.
3. Enter the Presentail OS URL and the pairing code.
4. On success, the agent stores the bearer token in **Windows Credential Manager**,
   registers the auto-start Registry key
   (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`), and begins monitoring
   `C:\PresentailScanner\Inbox`.

## Re-pairing

Right-click the tray icon → **Re-pair station** to:

- Clear the stored credential from Windows Credential Manager
- Clear the retry queue
- Reopen the setup window

## Logging

Logs are written as structured JSON lines to `%APPDATA%\PresentailScannerAgent\logs\`.

Sensitive fields (`token`, `authorization`, `content`, `text`, `raw`) are automatically
redacted. Response bodies are never logged — only HTTP status codes.

## Upload Protocol

Each file upload sends a `multipart/form-data` POST to `/api/scanner/upload`:

| Field               | Value                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `file`              | Binary file content                  |
| `captured_at`       | File mtime as ISO 8601 string        |
| `original_filename` | Original filename                    |
| `sha256`            | SHA-256 hex digest (idempotency key) |
| `agent_version`     | Agent version string                 |

Responses:

- **202** — accepted, newly imported
- **200 + `duplicate: true`** — already imported (idempotent)
- **4xx (permanent)** — file moved to `Failed\`
- **Network / 5xx** — file stays in `Inbox\`, retried with exponential back-off
